## 📘 Project Overview

**Client**: AtliQ Grands (a 5-star hotel group in India)  
**Objective**: Build a dynamic, insight-rich dashboard to help regain market share and drive strategic decisions.

AtliQ Grands has been operating in the hospitality industry for 20+ years. Due to competitive pressure and poor decision-making, they began losing revenue and market share. As part of their data intelligence initiative, I was brought in to analyze performance and build actionable dashboards.
